# Reverse-Text-Processor
This C++ project is a versatile utility for processing and reversing text data. It reads input from a file, filters and transforms the text, and then generates a reversed version of the text along with useful statistics.

Features:

Text Processing: The program efficiently filters and processes text data, excluding non-alphabetical characters and handling apostrophes within words.

Reversed Output: It reverses the filtered text, providing a reversed version of each input line.

Input Validation: The program ensures that input lines are within a defined character limit.

User Interaction: A user-friendly menu allows users to choose between processing text data and quitting the program.

Output Logging: Processed data is logged to an output file for further analysis or reference.

How to Use:

Compile and run the C++ program.
Choose the "Print Reverse" option from the menu.
Provide a text file as input.
The program will process and reverse the text, displaying the results in both the console and an output file.
This project is a practical example of text processing and showcases the use of C++ for file handling, data manipulation, and user interaction. Feel free to contribute, report issues, or use it as a reference for your own projects.
